= Cowboy

Cowboy is a small, fast and modern HTTP server for Erlang/OTP.

== Goals

Cowboy aims to provide a *complete* HTTP stack in a *small* code base.
It is optimized for *low latency* and *low memory usage*, in part
because it uses *binary strings*.

Cowboy provides *routing* capabilities, selectively dispatching requests
to handlers written in Erlang.

Because it uses Ranch for managing connections, Cowboy can easily be
*embedded* in any other application.

Cowboy is *clean* and *well tested* Erlang code.
